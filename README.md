A17_ EXECUTION_FILES_SVM.ipynb includes:
This python notebook explores Support Vector Machines to detect DeepFakes using the Linear, Gaussian RBF and Polynomial Kernels of Support Vector Machines,
with the polynomial kernel achieving the highest accuracy among them of 99.7%
Data preprocessing techniques include converting the images to vector format using Azimuthal Avaeraging.
The dataset for this implentation was extracted from the CelebA dataset and was trained on 10,000 images.
This was used as a baseline model.

A17__EXECUTION_FILES_DENSENETS.ipynb includes:
This python notebook explores DeneseNets a Deep Learning model to detect DeepFakes.
The dataset used for this implentation is the 140K real and fake faces dataset from Kaggle.
Data preprocessing techniques include converting the color image to a grayscale image.
6.9M features were used in the detection of DeepFakes and achieved an accuracy of 98%.
